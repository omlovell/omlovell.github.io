## Self-Assessment
My name is Owen Lovell; I have a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Originally, I started the Computer Science Program at SUNY Oswego in New York around 2020. I’ve been working a full-time job the entire time I have been in college. From there I continued with the degree until covid had changed the way we learned there so I was dropped from that school took a half a year break and started at SNHU in 2022-2023. In total the number of years I have been working in the computer science degree are about 5-6 years.	
My strengths are show in working with Java and Python, as seen in the enhancement done on my course work in converting a program from Java to Python. I’ve also worked on projects in C and C++.  Java, Python, C++, and C listed in order of most comfortable working with. There are many other languages I’ve learned and used in projects over the coursework at college that aren’t included. Working a full-time job and attending college was difficult but it improved my time-management skills, and problem-solving skills.  Other skills that were developed strongly throughout my coursework is the readability and maintainability of my work. Industry standard best practices were used heavily, meaning that I use descriptive naming conventions, in line comments, and make the code more readable so that it can be maintained if I’m no longer working on it consistently. My career plans involve working with Software Engineering on a team, Game Development, or any type of development/ coding in general. At Oswego I worked in a Software Development and Design course that we were paired up in groups of three, working with the teacher as a ‘client’ to design, develop, and test software that he wanted. Working in this group we learned the ability to work with each other, and with a ‘client’ on design choices. 
The first artifact was chosen for two enhancements in the categories of Software Design and Engineering and Algorithms and Data Structures. Showing skills in using two different languages, and using a different Data Structure better suited for the artifact. The Object-Oriented Programing in the two different languages can be seen in that artifact. The second artifact was chosen for the Database enhancement, switching from SQLite to MongoDB. This second artifact shows more than just skills in Database’s but working with CRUD and REST API’s and security practices.

#### Software Design and Engineering
##### Narrative
The artifact is a project created in CS-320 Software Testing/ Automation, created over a year ago. This artifact was included to show my skills in Java and Python, two languages I’m comfortable using. Specifically, this artifact showcases the use of Object-Oriented Programming. Another skill used is adaptability, with the switch to a different language syntax and different components are used to achieve the same task. The artifact will look more readable due to the syntax of Python, also the PEP 8 style guide for Python makes the code more readable, and in turn makes the code more maintainable over time. The course outcomes that I have achieved are demonstrating an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practice for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals. The other course outcome displayed by this work in Software Design and Engineering is Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. The second outcome shown was displayed in the original enhancement plan document which included flowcharts that demonstrated the workflow. The main challenges faced where going from the two different syntax of the two languages can be a struggle to not induce errors. In using a good IDE the syntax issue becomes less of an issue.

#### Algorithms and Data Structure
##### Narrative
The artifact is a project created in CS-320 Software Testing/ Automation, created over a year ago. The use of this artifact was included to show knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms by changing or making use of a different languages tools to improve the initial data structure. Originally the program used an array list, then after switching to python it used pythons lists to work with the data. The enhancement used Pythons dictionaries to improve the use of most of the original data structures where applicable. Specifically, the ability to work with data structures like Array’s, List’s, Dictionary’s (Maps) are all shown in this enhancement. Course outcomes meet in this enhancement are; Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. Another outcome that is shown is, develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. The main challenge faced was what the two languages offer for data structures, Java offers more that Python. Challenging as it was the use of the best data structure given the data was chosen and implemented to enhance the artifact.

#### Databases
##### Narrative
The original artifact for this enhancement was created in CS 360, Mobile Architect and Programming. Created under a year ago it is still a fresh project. Skills that would be shown are the ability to migrate to a new functional database, in this case from SQLite to MongoDB with a REST API. Course outcomes that were met are 
- Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
- Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
- Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
- Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

This project was originally going to use MongoDB Data Sync, but that was said to be depreciated so a REST API was created to talk to the program and MongoDB. Safety and Security was a big challenge, such as storing user passwords, entered information and making sure to only display correct information. In doing this enhancement I’ve learned that there is a lot to learn and still improve upon which will keep me interested in this career field.
